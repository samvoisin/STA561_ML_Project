# STA561 Probabilistic Machine Learning: Final Project - Spring 2019


Paper:

Data:

We will fit a perceptron with one layer and a perceptrion with >= 2 hidden layers. Our goal is to compare our model to the model described in the paper. We believe that a deeper network will have improved accuracy at only a marginally slower computational cost for an individual classification.


Current Tasks:

Sam - Making computation graph in ipython notebook; working on preliminary 1-layer NN from paper
Eduardo - 
Subastian - 
Yuan -
