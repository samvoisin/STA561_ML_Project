# STA561_ML_Project
Final project for Duke STA 561 - Probabilistic Machine Learning course - Spring 2019


Paper:

Data:

We will fit a perceptron with one layer and a perceptrion with >= 2 hidden layers. Our goal is to compare our model to the model described in the paper. We believe that a deeper network will have improved accuracy at only a marginally slower computational cost for an individual classification.
