Using the following Kaggle data set: https://www.kaggle.com/smit1212/diabetic-data-cleaning, which describes patient demographic and relevant diagnostic information for approximately 100,000 patients hospitalized with a diagnosis of diabetes. The goal would be to develop a model that would classify the patients based on their likelihood of being readmitted to the hospital after their initial discharge, or to create some sort of risk score associated with their particular patient demographics.

- Description of data: The dataset represents 10 years (1999-2008) of clinical care at 130 US hospitals and integrated delivery networks. It includes over 50 features representing patient and hospital outcomes.

Potential issues with this idea include:
- Missing data will need to be imputed. 

But, on the upside:
- We can fit multiple models and determine which performs best for prediction and/or is most appropriate.
- We may fit both black-box and interpretable models. One might be better for prediction, but the interpretable 
model could serve as a guide for physicians.
